          Bizum is a Fintech company that offers - among other services - instants payments as an alternative to conventional
          transfers. Born in 2012, it achieved to stablish itself as a tool that has already been integrated by most Spanish banks
          and used by more than 16 million users.

          Thatâ€™s why they needed to build a visual language that made reference to the breadth and diversity of their audience.

        To lay the foundations that would allow us to make sure that I was moving forward in the right direction, we started with
        a preliminary analysis of their users. They are very diverse - higly digitilized young people, older users, freelancers,
        banks, NGO.. The illustration system must therefore be very flexible and scalable to give the possibility of representing
        a wide range of users in all possible situations and scenarios.

          We built a new IA for their website in accordance to their users needs, but also to the companyâ€™s vision and goals for
          the future.After testing some mid-fi prototypes and getting to the right look & feel, the ecommerce changed completely
          allowing users to find much more easily what they were looking for. In only a couple of weeks since the first release,
          they went through the second biggest conversion rates since the web was born.
