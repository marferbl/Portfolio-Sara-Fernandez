        <p>
          Bizum is a Fintech company that offers - among other services - instants payments as an alternative to conventional
          transfers. Born in 2012, it achieved to stablish itself as a tool that has already been integrated by most Spanish banks
          and used by more than 16 million users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thatâ€™s why they needed to build a visual language that made reference to the breadth and diversity of their audience.

        To lay the foundations that would allow us to make sure that I was moving forward in the right direction, we started with
        a preliminary analysis of their users. They are very diverse - higly digitilized young people, older users, freelancers,
        banks, NGO.. The illustration system must therefore be very flexible and scalable to give the possibility of representing
        a wide range of users in all possible situations and scenarios. <br>
        In order to do that, we decided to export the atomic design system methodology to our illustration language.

        All characters would be built by putting together small pieces of information (atoms): hair styles, faces, trunks and legs. 
        Once together, they would shape a person (mollecule) that would interact with other characters and with objects. <br>
        By placing these mollecules in a context with a background, we would be able to create complex scenes and situations (organisms).
