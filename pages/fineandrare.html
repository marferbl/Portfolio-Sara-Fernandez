        <h4>Done at: Bwowstudio</h4>
        <h4>Client: Fine and Rare Wines</h4>
        <p>
          Since 1994 FINE+RARE is the leading online platform for both buying and selling fine wines and spirits â€“ and also for
          facilitating cellar management. They came to us looking for a user-centered redesign of their website and a complete
          change in their portfolio management software.
        </p>
        <p>I had the opportunity to face this challenge and to work together with their Dev, Branding and Customer team.</p>

          We built a new IA for their website in accordance to their users needs, but also to the companyâ€™s vision and goals for
          the future. </br>
          After testing some mid-fi prototypes and getting to the right look & feel, the ecommerce changed completely
          allowing users to find much more easily what they were looking for. </br>
          In only a couple of weeks since the first release,
          they went through the second biggest conversion rates since the web was born.

        But the real challenge here was the portfolio management dashboard. We needed to offer a very big amount of features for both advanced and very basic users, all that without sacrificing the usability and simplicity of the site.  We needed to offer an understandable view of all the items in the userâ€™s collection: the ones he had, 
        the ones that were purchased and on their way and the ones he had purchased but werenâ€™t still bottled.

        The complexity of the product made this project a real challenge that is still on progress by their dev team.
